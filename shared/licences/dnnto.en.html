  This includes works that are not in the public domain (i.e. less than 70 years has passed since the death of the last surviving
  author and they were published less than 50 or 110 years ago for monographs and periodicals respectively), but they cannot be
  found on the market anymore. The list of these works is overseen by the National Library of the Czech republic and to view it,
  visit <a href="https://dnnt.nkp.cz/seznam.html" target="_blank">this page</a>.
  Out-of-commerce works are available to registered users on grounds of a licence agreement between the National Library of the
  Czech republic and the collective rights’ management organisation DILIA and the association for the protection of authors’ rights 
  OOA-S. For further information on possibilities to access out-of-commerce works visit <a href="https://dnnt.nkp.cz/" target="_blank">this website</a>.

  Registered users of participating institutions have remote access to out-of-commerce works. One of these libraries is also the
  Moravian Library in Brno, which offers the possibility of remote <a href="https://www.mzk.cz/en/services/registration" target="_blank">registration</a> to its users. Unfortunately, digital documents are
  accessible to Czech residents  only (or to foreigners with temporary or residence or student’s permit etc.). The Moravian Library
  can't provide remote library registration for foreigners.
