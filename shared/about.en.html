Welcome to Digitalni knihovna, the digital library which offers digital documents through the Kramerius system and contains both free and copyrighted works of various genres in a web interface with access to multiple digital libraries in the Czech Republic. The Digital Library Web Design provides a simple and understandable way to work with digital documents. The Digital Library is operated by the Moravian Library in Brno.
